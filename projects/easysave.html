<p>As part of this school project. We have a role -playing game as a project group</p>

<p><strong>Project Title: EasySave</strong></p>

<p>EasySave is a software project developed to provide a comprehensive backup solution. The project has undergone several iterations, each providing enhanced features and functionalities.</p>

<p><strong>Version 1.0:</strong>
The first version was a console application developed using .Net Core. It allowed users to create up to 5 backup jobs, with specifications for source directory, target directory, and backup type. It supported both English and French languages and recorded all actions in a daily log file.</p>

<p><strong>Version 1.1:</strong>
An urgent update was required for a major client, resulting in the creation of version 1.1. This version included an additional feature allowing the user to choose the log file format, either XML or JSON.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.0:</strong>
The second major update transitioned the application from a console to a WPF-based user interface. This version allowed unlimited backup jobs, introduced file encryption via an external software called CryptoSoft, and added real-time monitoring of ongoing backup tasks. The application would now cease operation if a certain “business software” was detected to be running on the system.</p>

<p><strong>Version 3.0:</strong>
In the third major update, the application was restructured to execute backup jobs in parallel. It introduced priority handling for file backups, real-time interaction capabilities for backup jobs, temporary pause if a business software was detected running, and a remote monitoring console developed in WPF and communicated via Sockets. This version also enforced a single-instance limitation, preventing the application from being launched multiple times on the same machine.</p>

<p>Throughout all the versions, the project had an emphasis on careful GIT versioning, adherence to UML diagrams, and maintaining high-quality, non-redundant code.</p>

<p>For future updates, potential areas of focus include network load monitoring and automatic adjustment of data flow to avoid saturating the network.</p>

<p>This project offered an extensive exercise in .NET Core development, GUI design, multi-threading, network programming, and real-time system interactions. The EasySave project showcases advanced software development skills and a dedication to continuous product improvement.</p>
